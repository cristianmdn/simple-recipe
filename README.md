## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

This was a great experience. I learned how to:
- Link google fonts.
- Use incos.
- Write reusable code for CSS.
- How to use Media Queries.
- How to structure the HTML page and make it simple, and adding a few comments when necessary to make it more readable.
- How to read the CSS docs when I needed help to fix something before looking for a video tutorial.

I'm sure there are things that I didn't do right or that can be done better but for now, this is the best I can do for this project.
I will look for better solutions and continue to learn from them after I submit my project and share it to the community. Big thanks to the Frontend Mentor and Kyle from "Web Deb Simplified". You guys make incredible content.
